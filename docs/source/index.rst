Welcome to the Bern Medical Cyclotron Irradiation Facility's documentation!
===========================================================================

The **Bern Medical Cyclotron** is located in the `SWAN AG <https://www.swanisotopen.ch/>`_ premises within the Bern University Hospital (Inselspital) campus (`Find it here in Google maps!). <https://www.google.com/maps/place/SWAN+Isotopen+AG/@46.9469437,7.4205962,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x478e39a680958f55:0x629af903079e6da0!8m2!3d46.9469616!4d7.4228141>`_

The facility has a dual use: on one hand the production of radiotracers for medical imaging (managed by SWAN AG); on the other hand hosting research activities from the Medical Applications of Particle Physcs (MAPP) group of the Bern University's Laboratory for High Energy Physics (LHEP). 

This documentation aims at providing useful information to external users coming to the facility to perform radiation tests. At the same time it compiles several "How-To" guides for operating different pieces of equipment available in the facility.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
   Lumache has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.
